# Tennis Training Tracker

## Overview
This repository contains a customized tool for tracking and analyzing tennis training sessions. The primary focus is on enhancing ground strokes and serves through a structured practice routine and precise data tracking. The tool generates data files that are uploaded to a GitHub repository and displayed as detailed statistics on a dedicated website.

## Training Process

### Ground Strokes
- **Setup:** The ball machine is placed at the baseline with the randomizer mode activated. The machine is set to deliver balls at a speed of 120 km/h with a topspin of 1000 RPM. The frequency is set to approximately 1-2 shots per second, providing a challenging and realistic simulation.
- **Routine:** Each ground stroke session consists of 100 balls fired in sequence. The machine alternates shots left and right, simulating various on-court situations.
- **Tracking:** During the session, the number of missed balls is tracked mentally. After completing the round, the data is input into the Tennis Session Tracker, a customized GPT-based tool that records and processes the statistics.

### Serve Practice
- **Setup:** Following the ground strokes, the balls that were not reached or were hit into the net (typically 10-20 balls) are collected on one side of the court.
- **Routine:** These balls are then used for serve practice. The serve practice is structured as a simulation of a real service game, alternating between first and second serves and switching sides to replicate match conditions.
- **Tracking:** The tracker records the first serve percentage, second serve success, and the number of double faults. This data provides insights into serve consistency and effectiveness under game-like conditions.

## The Tennis Session Tracker
The Tennis Session Tracker is a customized GPT-based tool designed specifically for this training routine. It tracks all relevant statistics, including:
- **Ground Stroke Accuracy:** Percentage of successful hits during each round.
- **Serve Accuracy:** First and second serve percentages, including double faults.
- **Session Summary:** Comprehensive data from each session, compiled into a file for easy reference and analysis.

### Data Management
- **Data Files:** After each training session, the tracker generates a data file with all recorded statistics. This file is uploaded to a GitHub repository, ensuring a secure and organized storage of session data.
- **Website Integration:** The data is then displayed on a dedicated website, providing real-time statistics and performance insights. This allows for easy monitoring of progress and identification of areas for improvement.

## Future Developments
- **Enhanced Visualization:** The next step is to implement advanced data visualization on the website, allowing for better analysis of trends over time.
- **Mobile Integration:** Future versions of the tracker could include a mobile app for more convenient data entry and review on the go.
- **Community Features:** The possibility of sharing and comparing statistics with other players or trainers could add a competitive edge and foster a collaborative learning environment.

## Conclusion
This training tracker is designed to bring precision and structure to tennis practice. By leveraging technology, it allows players and trainers to gain deeper insights into their performance, identify weaknesses, and make informed decisions to enhance their game. The combination of ground stroke drills, realistic service game simulations, and detailed tracking provides a comprehensive approach to improving tennis skills.

Whether youâ€™re looking to refine your technique or track progress over time, this tool offers a clear and effective way to achieve your tennis training goals.
